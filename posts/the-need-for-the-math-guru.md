In the Eastern side of the world, a [guru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru) is often referred to as a teacher that helps students realize spiritual awakening. Students often seek out a guru to help them read a text that is obscure. The analogy of the guru is strong with math.

Not very many people learn to do math by themselves. In fact, our whole childhood math exposure is designed as a social activity. We are placed in classrooms with other children of the same age with a math teacher with much more experience with math.

The issue for parents is ensuring that their child has a great math teacher, and that the school is supportive of the needs of their students. Yet, speaking from personal experience, I can attest to the fact that this is not often the case.

Here at The Math Guru, we are building a platform for students to find the math tutor that best works for them. We transform self-talk from "I hate math" to "I love math!" We reverse the effects of math anxiety. A person that can do this is a guru.
