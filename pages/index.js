      <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
      <p>
        It is our belief that most people's difficulty with math is in their heads.
        We want to help students overcome their self-limiting beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        We exist to connect students with their Math Guru, a tutor that will transform their
        relationship with math from "I'm bad at math" to "I love math."
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, booking a session is the best way to support us if you're taking a math class.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're not taking a math class, share our services with your friends who are taking math classes.
      </p>
