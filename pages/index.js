          "I have used several math tutors in college and I finally have found a tutor who can explain the topics better than the professor and explain how to do the problem clearly. I was struggling before I started working with Caleb and now I am extremely confident with my math skills."

          "It was the beginning of the semester and I was thinking about dropping my Calculus I class for business majors. But my dad is very supportive of my education goals, so he hired Caleb to help make me feel confident in getting through the math. We met every week and Caleb make sure I got my homework done. I found his studying tips and tricks very helpful. I actually didn't need to take the last exam. Then I aced the final. I got an A+ in the class. Thanks Caleb!"

          "I was having a horrible second semester at ASU. I was failing Calculus II. I didn't want to have to take it again. That would have been expensive. It was late in the semester and I thought for sure there was no hope for me to turn things around. But fortunately my mom found Caleb online. He was very quick to respond and assued me that I could pass the class with his help. He was right. I ended up passing and I got an A+ on the final! I saved a lot of money and time with just a few sessions."

          "I’ve been preparing to take the HESI, the nursing entrance exam, for my nursing program. I was confident on most of the content, but I was still struggling with some of the math. Caleb refreshed me on everything from ratios & proportions to solving systems of equations. I’ve passed my HESI and got into my nursing program!"
